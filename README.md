### Abstract

Maps and geospatial information play an increasingly prominent role in the everyday lives of citizens in most "western" nations. Scholars also recognize that "the power of maps" stretches back in history to the origins of modern cartographic practice in the 15th and 16th centuries. Recent research shows that the nascent "data revolution" disrupts traditional power relations found in the visualization of geospatial information which can present opportunities for alternative mappings. One such alternative includes participatory mapping in which residents of a certain region or area become the cartographers who draw maps of their own territory. Some claim that participatory mapping can empower communities and increase democratic governance while others insist that the power of the map always lies with those who have the right to use force to legitimize the specific visualization of data. In this seminar several participatory mapping projects will be presented and given critique from a framework that includes critical cartography and on-the-ground experience with participatory mapping. The conclusion suggests that lessons learned from the participatory mapping experience can also be applied to allied data driven good governance initiatives.
